## Prediction of Pneumonia Based in Chest X-Ray Images with Streamit-Based Website

### Project Description 
Health issues are a global concern due to their direct impact on humans, such as lung disorders that can lead to death if ignored. Lung disorders like shortness of breath, chest pain, and productive cough often indicate Pneumonia, a lung infection caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi.

Globally, Pneumonia cases range from 1.5 to 14 per 1,000 people per year. In the United States, there are 24.8 cases per 10,000 people, while in the Philippines and Malaysia, the rates are 1425 and 99 cases per 10,000 people, respectively, among discharged hospital patients.

Pneumonia detection starts with symptom examination, followed by a chest X-ray, which is the "gold standard" in radiological examination. The X-ray results are then analyzed by a doctor to confirm the diagnosis.

To assist doctors in diagnosing Pneumonia, a prediction tool based on chest X-ray images is needed. Thus, a Streamlit-based website tool has been developed, allowing users to upload chest X-ray images and automatically receive predictions and confidence percentages of the results without replacing the doctor's role.
